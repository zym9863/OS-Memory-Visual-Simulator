# Operating System Memory Visual Simulator

**Language / ËØ≠Ë®Ä:** [English](./README_EN.md) | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./README.md)

---

An interactive Vue 3-based visual simulator for operating system memory allocation algorithms, supporting dynamic demonstration and performance comparison of various memory allocation algorithms.

## üéØ Core Features

### Feature 1: Dynamic Visual Simulation of Multiple Memory Allocation/Deallocation Algorithms
- **First Fit Algorithm**: Search for the first block large enough from the beginning of memory
- **Best Fit Algorithm**: Find the smallest block that is large enough to reduce memory waste
- **Worst Fit Algorithm**: Select the largest free block for allocation
- **Next Fit Algorithm**: Start searching for free blocks from the last allocation position

### Feature 2: Interactive User Operations and Parameter Configuration
- **Memory Configuration**: Customize total memory size (100KB - 2048KB)
- **Job Management**: Add, delete, and view job queues
- **Real-time Control**: Manual step-by-step execution, pause/resume, reset simulation
- **Dynamic Release**: Release allocated job memory at any time

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Memory Fragmentation Analysis
- Real-time display of fragment count and fragmentation rate
- Maximum free block size monitoring
- Average fragment size statistics

### Algorithm Performance Comparison
